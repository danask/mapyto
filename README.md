**MaPyto:earth_africa:** is a program that takes addresses as input and shows an "*optimized*" route on Google Map.

### How does it works ?

To do this, my program will sort the addresses step by step (that is, it will calculate the distances between the first address and the others, return the first adress in another list and place the nearest adress beginning of the original list, repeating until the original list is empty).

## If you want to try it out, just launch main.py !
